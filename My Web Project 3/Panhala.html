It is the nearest and best hill station near Kolhapur city. People visit during both in summer and monsoon. In summer the temperature at the Panhala hill is lower then Kolhapur city and nearby places so most of the people stay at the hill as there are a lot of options available to stay on the hill.

Various restaurants and hotels are available for tourist.

In monsoon, the fort turns into greenery panoramic view so most of the tourist visit Panhala hill station and also spend few days enjoying beautiful nature with hot and tasty delicacies. I personally enjoy a lot whenever I spend some time at the hill. I had traveled both in summer and during monsoon.

The Panhala as Fort
The Panhala fort is the only fort where the great Maratha warrior Shri Shivaji Maharaj spent more than 500 days beside Raigad and Shivneri. The Panhala Fort was Maratha State capital until 1782 and in 1827 it went to the British.

It is definitely worth visiting place taking into consideration its historical importance.

It was built by King Bhoja between 1178-1209 and is the largest of all Deccan forts. The innermost fortress is enclosed by a strong wall over 7 Km in length fortified by a support.
It is strategically located during that time over a pass in the Sahyadri mountain range which was a major trade route from Bijapur in the interior of Maharashtra to the coastal areas.
Due to its strategic location, it was the center of several battles in the Deccan involving the Marathas, the Mughals, and the British East India Company, and on the very notable battle was the Battle of Pavan Khind.
Here, the queen of Kolhapur State, Tarabai, spent her critical years. Several parts of the fort and the structures within are still intact.
BajiPrabhu Deshpande
Panhala as a historic fort throws up memories of Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
It was from here that Shivaji struggled for over four months and escaped one rainy night to Vishalgad fort, while his faithful soldier Shri Baji Prabhu Deshpande sacrificed his life holding down the forces of Siddi Johar at a narrow pass since it is called as a battle of Pavankhind.
It was here in the same building, Sajja Kothi, built by Ibrahim Adil-Shah in 1500 AD, that Shivaji imprisoned his son Shri Sambhaji who later escaped.
