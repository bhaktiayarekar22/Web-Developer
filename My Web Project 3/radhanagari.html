            Radhanagari wildlife sanctuary (Dajipur forest)
Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary is also called as Dajipur Wildlife Sanctuary is one of the best adventurous and wild life places near Kolhapur in the state of Maharastra in India.

Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary is one of the world heritages in Maharashtra.

The Dajipur wildlife sanctuary is declared as natural World Heritage Site by UNESCO of category ix and x since 2012 in Maharashtra state, India.

It lies at the southern end of the Sahyadri hills in the Western Ghats. It is notable as the first declared wildlife sanctuary in Maharashtra notified in 1958.


The Dajipur Wildlife Sanctuary is also known as Bison Sanctuary. The sanctuary is surrounded by dense as well as thick forests.

The Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary is a place worth exploring, not only in any particular season but in all seasons which totally depends on tourist’s interest.

The land of Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary is the perfect, lush green, rising and falling landscape with steep valleys and located around 75 km from Kolhapur city in Maharashtra.

Though it is named as Bison Sanctuary, it is the home of various birds, small mammals, reptiles and wild animals such as the Indian bison, deer, monkeys, wild boars, bears and chitals. The sanctuary also has a watchtower near the Manora watering hole.

Prior to independence, Chhtrapati Shahu Maharaj (the king of Kolhapur) reserved this forest mainly for hunting and he also constructed a dam on River Bhogawati near Radhanagari which is called as Radhanagari dam.



His farsighted vision resulted in the conservation of this untouched landscape and wildlife therein.

In 1958 part of this forest was declared as ‘Dajipur Wildlife Sanctuary’, the first wildlife protected area in Maharashtra.

In 1985 more area is added and it was notified as ‘Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary’ covering an area of around 351 sq.km.

The forest area is predominantly semi-evergreen with undisturbed and thick evergreen patches, locally called ‘dang’, at many places. The notable among these are ‘kala Dang’ and ‘Patyacha Dang’.

Apart from this, there are many open grass lands inside the forest, which are grazing grounds for various animals in this sanctuary.

If you really like to spend time away from hustle and pollution of city then prefer to spend time in nature, trees, birds, animals and river at Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary.

You can also visit Radhanagri Dam which was built by Shri Shahu Maharaj in the year 1907. Do you know this was the first dam built in India? It is worth to visit and take a look.

            This Gravity dam (A gravity dam is a dam constructed from concrete or stone masonry and designed to hold back water by primarily using the weight of the material alone to resist the horizontal pressure of water pushing against it.
            
            Gravity dams are designed so that each section of the dam is stable, independent of any other dam section.)

            Read more about Gravity dam was one of the Engineering beauties in the year 1907 constructed by visionary Shri Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj on a Bhogawati river near Radhanagari in Maharashtra.
            
            This is the first-ever built dam in India. The Dam was constructed in the year 18 February 1907.
            
            The chief engineer of this dam was Sir Pandurang rao Krishnaji rao Shinde.
            
            The dam is being used for irrigation as well as hydroelectricity power generation. The dam is located amidst a scenic surrounding in the backdrop of thick forest cover.
            
            
            I was bit delighted to read how our earlier Indians were visionary and thought about future generations at the time where there were no technological advancements.
            
            The surrounding area of Radhanagari Dam is located at a very picturesque spot, with an attractive backdrop of thick forest covers.
            
            The place is a home for many birds and various varied plants and flowers. The larger number of tourist visits this place each year to see the spectacular bird species around the Radhanagiri Dam.
